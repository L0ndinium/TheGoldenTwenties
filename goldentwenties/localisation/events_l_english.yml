 germany.3.d:0 "A tragedy took place at the Reichstag earlier today when masses gathered to protest against a new law dictating that Corporations with 20 or more employees must elect a representative. When it came to clashes, about 40 protesters were shot by security forces, and another hundred wounded. The final numbers are still unclear, but this is yet another symptom of instability in our country..."
 germany.3.a:0 "Regrettable."
 germany.3.b:0 "Perhaps we should repeal the law?"

 germany.4.d:0 "A referendum has just taken place in Northern Schleswig: The area was supposed to be transferred to Denmark after the Great War, but it was decided to have a popular vote decide.

 germany.6.t:0 "Germany cedes Northern Schleswig"
 germany.6.d:0 "After the Great War, the territory of Northern Schleswig was supposed to be transferred to us right away - but it took its time due to the decision to revise and hold a popular referendum.

 germany.6.a:0 "Neat."
 germany.7.t:0 "Creation of the NSDAP"
 germany.7.d:0 "Today a new faction was founded in Munich: The NSDAP. It appears to be yet another right-wing party that denounces our Republic, but they don't appear to be any threat, literally having been founded in a beer house. This movement can most likely be ignored - but if we feel the need to, we could also declare a brief state of emergency to bypass our constitution and pass a law to ban it."
 germany.7.a:0 "Noted."
 germany.7.b:0 "They deserve our support..."
 germany.7.c:0 "This party goes against every value we represent - ban them immediately!"

 germany.8.a:0 "Concerninng."
 germany.9.t:0 "The Kapp Putsch"
 germany.9.d:0 "A devastating coup has happened in Berlin earlier today, when Wolfgang Kapp and the \"Brigade Erhardt\", a former Freikorps occupied Berlin with the help of a few Reichswehr soldiers and forced the government to flee. Reportedly, they want to install a counter-revolutionary government akin to the one of the former German Empire - there already have been set up no-go zones in the city, and heavy clashes with our armed forces are already taking place. This matter will need a few days to take care of at least..."

 germany.10.t: "Crippling strikes all over Germany"
 germany.10.d: "In response to the Kapp Putsch, and the various problems caused by it, several million of our citizens have taken to the streets today in a massive strike, crippling our economy and further destabilizing our country..."
 germany.10.a: "As if we didn't have enough problems already..."
 germany.11.t: "Revolt in the Ruhr!"
 germany.11.d: "A left-wing movement of workers in the Ruhr has declared an open war against our government! They are angered due to the terrible conditions that post-war destruction and political instability, especially the Kapp Putsch, have brought unto us. We will probably have to dispatch the army to deal with those riots..."
 germany.11.a: "Verdammt!"
 germany.12.t:0 "NSDAP Speech in Munich"
 germany.12.d:0 "The newly founded NSDAP has held a rally in Munich today. A charismatic young man by the name of Adolf Hitler was holding a speech - we identified him as a soldier from the Great War. His words seemed to agitate the people, but there still seems to be no threat from this small movement."
 germany.12.a:0 "Why should we even care?"
 germany.12.b:0 "We should try to keep our population away from this party."

 fiume.1.t:0 "A new Republic?"
 fiume.1.d:0 "Seeing as we have now gathered a bit of reputation as a free state on the stage of world politics, perhaps it is time to make ourselves an actual free state - by establishing a Republic, the Free State of Fiume."
